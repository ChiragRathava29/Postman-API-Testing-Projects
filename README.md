# 🧪 Postman API Testing Projects

This repository showcases a series of **Postman API Testing Projects** developed as part of my learning journey and certification path. These projects demonstrate end-to-end testing skills across REST and SOAP APIs, utilizing tools such as **Newman**, **Postman Scripting**, and **HTML Extra Reporting**.

newman run "<collection_file>.postman_collection.json" \
  --environment "<env_file>.postman_environment.json" \
  --reporters cli,htmlextra
```

To install the extra HTML reporter:

```bash
npm install -g newman-reporter-htmlextra
```
